# airbnb_analysis
This project appears to be a Streamlit web application for analyzing Airbnb data. 
Let me break down what each part of the code does:

Import Statements: The code imports necessary libraries such as Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly Express, PyMongo, MySQL Connector, and others.

Streamlit Configuration: It configures Streamlit settings such as page title, layout, and initial sidebar state.

Connection Class: Defines a class named connection for connecting to a MongoDB database using PyMongo.

Functions:

air_main(): Retrieves Airbnb data from MongoDB and preprocesses it into a Pandas DataFrame.
air_host(), air_address(), air_availability(), air_amenities(): These functions retrieve specific information about hosts, addresses, availability, and amenities respectively from the MongoDB collection and process them into DataFrames.
creating_dataframe(): Merges data from different sources into a single DataFrame and displays the raw data.
data_to_sql(): Inserts the merged DataFrame into a MySQL database.
delete_table(): Deletes data from the MySQL table.
Streamlit UI:

Defines background colors and styles for the UI.
Sidebar menu with options for transferring data to the database or viewing raw data.
Displays a welcome message.
Depending on the selected option, either transfers data to the database or displays raw data in a DataFrame.
Overall, this code fetches Airbnb data from MongoDB, processes it, provides options for analysis, and allows transferring the data to a MySQL database.
